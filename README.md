# kedr
Keras-based online digit recognizer

You just draw your one digit by mouse, and kedr recognize it! Magic! 

## Requirements

This is a package list that provides me a workable environment. Some troubles can be shoot through installing correct version of packages.

0. WinPython 3.5.2.2
1. Keras 1.1.2
2. Numpy 1.11.2+mkl
3. Pillow 3.3.1
4. Flask 0.11.1 + Flask-Cors 2.1.2
5. h5py 2.6.0

## Launch

There is only unstable version of kedr, so it's needed to unpack repository at C:\kedr only (I'm so sorry for that). After unpacking just type in cmd:

'''bash
python core.py
'''

Then there is an access to http://127.0.0.1:5000. Enjoy it!
